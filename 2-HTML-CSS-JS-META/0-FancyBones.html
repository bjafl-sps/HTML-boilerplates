<!-- Simple template WITH META TAGS and Javascript. 
  
  - Meta tags provide information about the site, and belong in the <head> section. 
  - Meta in most computing context refers to 'about self', meaning information about a object, document or other piece of data.
  - Metadata is a commonly used term, which can be explained as 'data about the data'
  - Examples of metadata can be file size, last edited date, author, title, languate, format, and so on...
  - Metadata provides very useful information, both for humans and computers. Metadata helps computers to know how to interpret 
    and handle data, and gives humans key information about the data like the title and number of pages for a book.
  - Meta tags in HTML provides such metadata. The data is primarly handled by computer software, like a client browser.
    Some of the data is never passed on to the end-user, like encoding (<meta charset"...">). Other data, like description and author,
    will be passed on to the user in certain contexts, and at the same time be used by software like web crawler for search engine 
    indexing.
  - Providing metadata is optional, but some key data is highly recommended and need to be included to comply to different
    universal standards, like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and other W3C standards and guidelines. 
    For more information about W3C standards, check out https://www.w3.org/standards/
    Metatags are also important for web pages to be displayed apropriatly across different devices, 
    helps with social media integration and so on.
  - There are a lot of possible meta tags you can use, but there is no need to include more than you need.
  - Below are some basic meta tags, that can be useful for most webpages.

  -->

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- character encoding -->
    <!-- Why: 
    - Encoding is how the document is translated from ones and zeros to the text displayed on screen.
    - There are many different encodings, but utf-8 is standard now and is able to store most international 
      characters and symbols.
    - You can see encoding at the bottom right of VS Code editor. 
    - Please include following meta-tag to let the client browser know the encoding used in this file is utf-8
    -->
    <meta charset="utf-8" />

    <!-- viewport metadata -->
    <!-- Why:
    - Important for responsive and mobile compatible web design.
    - The settings below renders the page in viewport with width set to width of client device.
    - Scale can be from 0.0 to 10.0, 1 in settings below give 1:1 ratio between viewport width and device width
    - Check out following link for refrence about available options. The settings below are ok for most cases.
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name#standard_metadata_names_defined_in_other_specifications

    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />

    <title><!-- your title here... --></title>
    <!-- title displayed in title bar of client web browser -->
    <!-- optional metadata about page -->
    <!-- Why:
    - Provides information about your page
    - Not displayed to client directly, but are for instance used by search engines to display
      information about your page in search results.
  -->
    <meta name="description" content="PUT_DESCRIPTION_HERE" />
    <meta name="author" content="PUT_AUTHOR/COMPANY_HERE" />

    <!-- OpenGraph metadata: Optional metadata for social media integration -->
    <!-- Why:
    - If you want your page to be easily shared on social media, you should add som basic Open Graph metadata
    - This data helps post generation on social media, so that new posts includes the image, title and description you want.
    - Type specification can help pure video / media content to be displayed apropriatly
    - URL specifivation ensures that the social media post points to the preferred URL (canonical URL) and not som alternative or
      temporary URL that may fail.
    - If social media (or similar) integration is not needed, this part can safely be omitted
    - Below are some basic OpenGraph meta properties that may be useful to include. 
    - Check out https://ogp.me/ for full refrence and list of available options.
    -->
    <meta property="og:title" content="PUT_TITLE_HERE" />
    <!-- page title -->
    <meta property="og:type" content="website" />
    <!-- page type. 'website' is a general refrence to a website. For accepted options, see https://ogp.me/#types -->
    <meta property="og:url" content="FULL_URL_TO_PAGE" />
    <!-- url to webpage. Pick canonical URL (the preferred url to the page, if it's reachable by several urls) -->
    <meta property="og:description" content="PUT_DESCRIPTION_HERE" />
    <!-- description to be displayed on social media post -->
    <meta property="og:image" content="PUT_RELATIVE_URL_TO_IMAGE_HERE" />
    <!-- image to be displayed on social media post -->

    <!-- favicons -->
    <!-- Why:
    - Set icon to be displayed in title bar of your browser, used for bookmarks and so on.
    - Usually a 16x16 pixel image in GIF, PNG, SVG or ICO format.
    - You don't need to use all the lines below, check comment for explanation
    -->
    <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
    <!-- for legacy (old) browser support. -->
    <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.svg" type="image/svg+xml" />
    <!-- for modern browsers. The image file can also be in png, gif or jpg format-->
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-touch-icon.png" />
    <!-- used for apple home screen shortcuts. -->
    <link
      rel="apple-touch-icon"
      sizes="120x120"
      href="/apple-touch-icon-120x120.png"
    />
    <!-- multiple icons with sizes property can be provided, to fit different devices. -->
    <!-- Comment: Sizes property can also be applied to rel="icon" links. Browser will pick most suitable icon. SVG is vector format image, and will be rendered when displayed.
                With vector graphics, different sizes is not needed.-->

    <!-- link to stylesheet resource -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="0-MetaBones.css" />
    <!-- Refrence to javascript resource (optional, only if using javascript)-->
    <script src="0-MetaBones.js" ></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- your content here... -->
